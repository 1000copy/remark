### To do

* Enable print preview via shortcut to show all slides at once with print CSS.
* Document DOM and embedded CSS - a kind of "styling guide for remark".

### Ideas

* Add "magic" slide class handled by remark to fit slide content to slide size to some degree, maybe some specified percentage, i.e. .remark-autofit / .remark-autofit-80.
* Have content classes support multiple lines, and perhaps have multiple lines generate DIV tags and single line SPAN tags.
* Support loading markdown from separate file instead of being loaded from the embedded TEXTAREA tag.
