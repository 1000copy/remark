# What is remark?

A simplistic, in-browser, markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS, featuring:

- Markdown formatting, with smart extensions

- Automatic syntax highlighting, with optional language hinting

- Slide scaling, thus similar appearance on all devices / resolutions .red[*]

.footnote[.red[*] At least browsers are trying their best]

---

# HTML Container

A simple HTML container for hosting the styles, markdown and the slides themselves is needed:

    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src="remark.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
          /* Slideshow styles */
        &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;pre id="source"&gt;
          <!-- Slideshow markdown -->
        &lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;div id="presentation"&gt;<!-- Generated slides -->&lt;div&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

You may [download `remark.js`](https://github.com/gnab/remark/downloads) to have your slideshow not depend on any online resources, or reference the latest version online directly.

# Slideshow Markdown

The slideshow itself is represented by a Markdown-formatted chunk of text:

    .no-highlight
    # Slide 1

    This is the first slide.
    
    ---

    # Slide 2

    This is the second slide.

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception: 

  - A blank line followed by three dashes constitues a new slide  
  (not a horizontal rule, `&lt;hr /&gt;`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're new to markdown formatting.

# Markdown Extensions

To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few extensions have been included:

- Slide classes, for styling entire slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

---

# Slide Classes

A line containing one or more dotted CSS class names is extracted, and the specified classes are applied to the current slide:

    .no-highlight
    .center.middle

    # Slide with content centered in both dimensions

Resulting HTML extract:

    &lt;div id="presentation"&gt;
      &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;div class="content center middle"&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Slide with content centered in both dimensions&lt;/h1&gt;

The `center` and `middle` classes are included along with a few other common case classes.

---

# Content Classes

Any occurences of one ore more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

    .no-highlight
    \.footnote[.red.bold[*] At least browsers try their best]

Resulting HTML extract:

    &lt;span class="footnote"&gt;
      &lt;span class="red bold"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; At least browsers try their best
    &lt;/span&gt;

---

# Automatic Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically syntax highlighted, based on the number of recognized keywords from a set of supported languages.

If the language detected is incorrect, you may specify the language to use by adding a dotted language class on the first line of code:

    .no-highlight
    Code:

        .ruby
        def add(a, b)
          a + b
        end

    Inline code: `.ruby a = 5`

To disable syntax highlighting, use the class `.no-highlight no-highlight`.

    </pre>
    <div id="presentation"></div>
  </body>
</html>
