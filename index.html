# What is remark?

A simplistic, in-browser, markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS, featuring:

- Markdown formatting, with smart extensions

- Automatic syntax highlighting, with optional language hinting

- Slide scaling, thus similar appearance on all devices / resolutions .red[*]

.footnote[.red[*] At least browsers are trying their best]

---

# Why use remark?

Since the slideshow is expressed using Markdown, you may:

- Focus on the content, expressing yourself in next to plain text not worrying what flashy graphics and disturbing effects to put where

Since the slideshow is actually an HTML document, you may:

- Display it in any decent browser

- Style it using regular CSS, just like any other HTML content

Since the slideshow is contained in a file, you may:

- Store it wherever you like; on your computer, hosted from your Dropbox, hosted on Github Pages alongside the stuff you're presenting...

- Keep track of changes using your favourite SCM tool, like Git or Mercurial

---

# How does it work?

A Markdown-formatted chunk of text contained in an HTML document is processed and separated into individual slides - all handled by JavaScript running in the browser.

# HTML Document

A simple HTML document is needed for hosting the styles, markdown and the generated slides themselves:

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src="remark.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
          /* Slideshow styles */
        &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;pre id="source"&gt;
          <!-- Slideshow markdown -->
        &lt;/pre&gt;
        &lt;div id="slideshow"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

You may [download `remark.js`](https://github.com/gnab/remark/downloads) to have your slideshow not depend on any online resources, or reference the latest version online directly.

# Slideshow Markdown

The slideshow itself is expressed by a Markdown-formatted chunk of text:

    .no-highlight
    # Slide 1

    This is the first slide.
    
    ---

    # Slide 2

    This is the second slide.

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception: 

  - A blank line followed by three dashes constitues a new slide  
  (not a horizontal rule, `&lt;hr /&gt;`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're new to markdown formatting.

---

# Markdown Extensions

To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few extensions have been included:

- Slide classes, for styling entire slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

---

# Slide Classes

A line containing one or more dotted CSS class names is extracted, and the specified classes are applied to the current slide:

    .no-highlight
    .center.middle

    # Slide with content centered in both dimensions

Resulting HTML extract:

    &lt;div id="slideshow"&gt;
      &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
        &lt;div class="content center middle"&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Slide with content centered in both dimensions&lt;/h1&gt;

The `center` and `middle` classes are included along with a few other common case classes.

---

# Content Classes

Any occurences of one ore more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

    .no-highlight
    \.footnote[.red.bold[*] At least browsers try their best]

Resulting HTML extract:

    &lt;span class="footnote"&gt;
      &lt;span class="red bold"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; At least browsers try their best
    &lt;/span&gt;

---

# Automatic Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically syntax highlighted, based on the number of recognized keywords from a set of supported languages.

If the language detected is incorrect, you may specify the language to use by adding a dotted language class on the first line of code:

    .no-highlight
    Code:

        .ruby
        def add(a, b)
          a + b
        end

    Inline code: `.ruby a = 5`

To disable syntax highlighting, use the class `.no-highlight no-highlight`.
